# Covid-19_Trend_Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on COVID-19 cases in various countries. The analysis includes the visualization of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases for each country in the dataset.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains COVID-19 data for multiple countries. The data was extracted form Kaggle . It includes the following columns:

Country: The name of the country.
Confirmed: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each country.

Analysis
The main goal of this analysis is to visualize the trends of COVID-19 cases (confirmed, deaths, and recovered) for each country in the dataset. The Python programming language is used for data manipulation and visualization.

The analysis includes the following steps:

Loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Plotting line graphs for each country to show the trends of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases over time.
Identifying the country with the most recovered cases and the country with the minimum recovered cases.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib).
Open a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment to run the analysis.
Execute the code to visualize the COVID-19 trends for each country and find the country with the most and minimum recovered cases.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
